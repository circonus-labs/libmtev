# libmtev changes

# 1


## 1.12

 * More protections from NPE in eventer SSL code.
 * Add console-accessible statistics for the `mtev_fq` module via `show fq`.
 * Fix assertion failure in AMQ code

### 1.12.17

 * Decode `+` to space in querystring decoding.

### 1.12.16

 * Fix potential off-by-one error in clustering

### 1.12.15

 * Fix stack smash on CHT lookups on clusters with W>16.
 * Increase max W for CHTs to 256

### 1.12.14

 * Fix missing top of crash stacktrace when libunwind is being used.
 * Make the 'SSL layer X not understood' a debug message if X is being
   explicitly disabled.
 * Fix `segment_size` and `precommit` config processing for `jlog` logs.

### 1.12.13

 * Ensure enough bchain space for over-sized headers. Large headers would
   previously cause an assertion.

### 1.12.12

 * Allow `<config>` in `<eventer>` to be a deep descendent.

### 1.12.11

 * Allow OPTIONS in rest layer.

### 1.12.10

 * Fix uninitialized read in `mtev_b32_decode` and `mtev_b64_decode` in the slow path.

### 1.12.9

 * Add function, `eventer_jobq_drain_and_shutdown` to drain all inflight
   and backlog jobs, then despawn all threads.

### 1.12.8

 * Revert some internal changes to selection of the active zipkin span.
   These are believe to lead to some hard to track use-after-free issues.

### 1.12.7

 * Fix reference counting bug in `mtev_zipkin_aco_swap_span`

### 1.12.6

 * Skip a lua stack attempt on failed resumption.
 * Fix compile issue with clang and eventer spec instantiation.
 * Improve the zipkin implementation to be more aware and friendly in ACO.

### 1.12.5

 * Fix bug in `mtev_plock_try_rtos` in `MTEV_PLOCK_HEAVY` mode where multiple
   threads could enter the S critical section.
 * Support `-DMTEV_MEMORY_DEBUG` to track alloc/free stacks for `mtev_memory_safe`
   operations.
 * Introduce new version global symbols to assist debuggers.
 * Add `mtev_log_backtrace` that will print a previously captured backtrace.
 * `MTEV_RDTSC_ENABLE` now replaces `MTEV_RDTSC_DISABLE` (defaults to off)
 * Add flexible conf interpolation system supporting `{{<impl>:<fallback>:{<term>}}}`

   `packages`, `cores`, and `pus`.
 * Add a conf interpolation implementation for `ENV`.

### 1.12.4

 * Add `mtev_memory_regular_ck_malloc` for unsafe/regular memory allocations

### 1.12.3

 * Various coverity fixes.
 * Support the new `MLKV()` macro instead of `MLKV{}` mistake if
   `MTEV_USE_MLKV_2` is defined.  This will become the default in the next
   major release and users can get their code ready now by adding
   `-DMTEV_USE_MLKV_2` to their CPPFLAGS. This is not ABI breaking, but next
   release will break the ABI such that C++ can be supported.
 * Fix string-matching in `mtev_logic`

### 1.12.2

 * Add functional probability for `mtev_frrh` via `mtev_frrh_set_prob_function`
 * Remove `noitedit/strlcpy.h` header and provide that via `mtev_str.h`
 * Add `mtev_strlcpy` and `mtev_strlcat`.

### 1.12.1

 * Runtime detection of ASAN to avoid `stack-buffer-underflow` failures
   when apps use ACO. (runtime avoids memcpy for stack replacement)
 * Allow basic use of logging immediately at application start (before init).
 * Add `mtev_log_hexdump_ex`
 * Add documentation for the logging facilities.

### 1.12.0

 * Fix more json-lib brokeness (bad pointers).
 * Remove `is_error` and `error_ptr` from json-lib implementation.
 * Only install public `mtev_json` headers.

## 1.11

### 1.11.3 (broken)

 * Break the `mtev_json_token_parse{,_filename,_fd}` APIs as they were
   atrociously dangerous.  No one could have possibly been using these
   correctly.
 * Fix an issue where valid SSL connections that do not handshake in one
   non-blocking action would register a spurious certificate error.
 * Inform lua bindings of TLS1.3.
 * Change `mtev_plock` atomic mode to `pause` instead of `repnop` for stall.
 * Add `mtev_log_hexdump`

### 1.11.2

     * Add `dhparam_bits` for forcing a DH parameter bit length (0 disables)
   * Update `ssl_dhparams` eventer options to 
   * Improve readability of SSL/crypto error messages
   * NPN upgrades could reference a stale context resulting in crashes
   * Fix multi-protocol NPN/ALPN negotiations

   * More robust HTTP testing, including intermediate cert chains.
   * HTTP/2 no long performs unsolicited compression to appease curl
 * Allow header inclusion from C++
 * Update lua ssl bindings to support extensiable context creation.
 * Update mtev.exec (and this mtev.sh) lua to accept environment that is
   a key,value table instead of just an array of key=value strings
 * luamtev improvements:
   * Make luamtev `print` default to stdout instead of stderr
   * Fix non-tty input when in interactive mode
   * Fix -e flag for running methods other than main
   * Add -h flag for help with a clean exit code

 * Enable coverage reporting using lcov `--enable-coverage`
 * New ptrace module that enumerates HTTP requests when using `http_observer`

## 1.10

   details.
 * Allow structured logging via flatbuffers and support variant format
   logging outputs: flatbuffer, and json.
 * Deprececate and disable log dedupping.
 * Fix mpmc ck_fifo in mtev_log to be 16-byte aligned.

### 1.8.2

 * File-based (and stderr) logs now split newlines into separate

   cores as this is what callers were expecting. (people should not run w/
   hyper-threading anyway).
 * Expose a useful coverity model for libmtev.

### 1.8.0

 * Rudimentary support for a lua stack tracer on crashes where luajit
   is in the C stacks (requires the luajit source headers).
 * Make aco_resume not offend the ASAN stack underflow detection.

   (this prevents pathological mmap leaks if programmers fail to compact).
 * Fix several http bugs around payload reading.
 * Fix mtev.notify/mtev.waitfor when the notify originates in an unyieldable
