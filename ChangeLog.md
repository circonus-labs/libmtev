# libmtev changes

# 1

## 1.6

### 1.6.0

 * Add HTTP/2 support (via libnghttp2).
   * A TLS-enabled listener may disable HTTP/2 upgrade support by setting an
     `npn` value of `none` in the
     [sslconfig](http://circonus-labs.github.io/libmtev/config/listeners.html#sslconfig).
 * Console listeners may now specify an optional `history_file` attribute to
   preserve command history across console sessions.
 * Reduce memory usage in highly concurrent configurations on Linux by limiting
   the number of file descriptors in a given invocation of `epoll_wait`.
 * Fix memory leak in SMR queue during thread shutdown.
 * Make base64 decoding also accept URL alphabet
   ([rfc4648](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4648)).
 * Fix crash in hash to lua table conversion where value is NULL.
 * Provide mtev_intern compaction as a side effect of `mtev_intern_release`
   (this prevents pathological mmap leaks if programmers fail to compact).
 * Fix several http bugs around payload reading.
 * Fix mtev.notify/mtev.waitfor when the notify originates in an unyieldable
   context and a waitfor is pending. (C -> lua -> C -> lua -> mtev.notify)

## 1.5

### 1.5.28

 * Fix failed merge (install target broken).

### 1.5.27

 * Fix mtev_intern memory volatility/ordering issues.

### 1.5.26

 * Fix ACO registry mismanagement causing crashes.

   of a block (bug introduced in 1.5.24)

### 1.5.24

 * Fix DNS fast failures in lua could cause null pointer dereference.
 * Fix support for aco-style REST handlers. This bug manifested as failed
   upload support.
 * Fix naming of aco events.  They now report the underlying event.
 * Rearchitect the watchdog timeouts to allow children to cooperate and signal
   into the correct thread so we get a SIGTRAP-induced stack trace from the
   offending thread. (only systems with pthread_sigqueue, like Linux).
 * Articulate in logs and in glider invocation which thread watchdogged.

### 1.5.23

 * Do not block thread exit for SMR, instead disown the return queue and
   allow gc thread to cleanup (this also fixes leaks at thread exit) #465

### 1.5.22

 * Eventer thread naming no longer requires SMR.
 * Fix REST-driven jemalloc heap profiler.

   could allow two bytes of overrun in decoding into a "too small" buffer.
 * Documentation fixes.

   manner. See the [Eventer (ACO)](http://circonus-labs.github.io/libmtev/development/eventer-aco.html)

 * Fix for misuse of non-file-descriptor events as file-descriptor events. Apps
   will now crash if they misuse events this way, rather than being allowed to,
   for example, call `eventer_close` on a non-file-descriptor event, which
   would have undefined behavior. (#375)

   disk-backed hash table of arbitrary size. If a dependency on LMDB is
   undesirable, one may configure with `--disable-lmdb`.
 * Change SONAME to include just the major version, making future minor-version
   bumps easier.
