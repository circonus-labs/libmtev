This return the first thread when 0 is passed as an argument.  All non-zero arguments
are spread acorss the remaining threads (if existent) as `n` modulo one less than
the concurrency of the default event pool.

This is done because many systems aren't thread safe and can only schedule their
work on a single thread (thread 1). By spreading all thread-safe workloads across
the remaining threads we reduce potential overloading of the "main" thread.

To assign an event to a thread, use the result of this function to assign:
`e->thr_owner`.

  * `n` an integer.
  * **RETURN** a pthread_t of an eventer loop thread in the specified evneter pool.

This function chooses a thread within the specified pool by taking `n`
modulo the concurrency of the pool.  If the default pool is speicified, special
assignment behavior applies. See [`eventer_choose_owner`](c.md#eventerchooseowner).

To assign an event to a thread, use the result of this function to assign:
`e->thr_owner`.


#### eventer_close

or other system facilities.

#### eventer_init_globals

>Initialize global structures required for eventer operation.

```c
void 
eventer_init_globals()

eventer_is_loop(pthread_t tid)
```


  * `tid` a thread

with the event in question and the closure specified at registration time.

  * `e` and event object
  * **RETURN** name of callback

The returned value may be a pointer to reusable thread-local storage.

necessary activity to make progress.


#### eventer_ref

>Add a reference to an event.

```c
void 
eventer_ref(eventer_t e)
```


  * `e` the event to reference.

Adding a reference to an event will prevent it from being deallocated
prematurely.  This is classic reference counting.  It is are that one
needs to maintain an actual event past the point where the eventer
system would normally free it.  Typically, one will allocate a new
event and copy the contents of the old event into it allowing the
original to be freed.


#### eventer_remove

>Remove an event object from the eventer system.

```c
eventer_t 
eventer_remove(eventer_t e)
```

eventer_set_mask(eventer_t e, int mask)
```


  * `e` an event object
  * `mask` a new mask

Do not change change a mask from one event "type" to another. fd events
must remain fd events. Timer must remain timer. Recurrent must remain recurrent.
Do not alter asynch events at all.  This simply changes the mask of the event
without changing any eventer state and should be used with extremem care.
Consider using the callback's return value or `eventer_update` to change
the mask of an active event in the system.


#### eventer_set_owner

>Set the thread that owns an event.

```c
void 
eventer_set_owner(eventer_t e, pthread_t t)
```

eventer_trigger(eventer_t e, int mask)
```


  * `e` an event object that is not registered with the eventer.
  * `mask` the mask to be used when invoking the event's callback.

This is often used to "start back up" an event that has been removed from the
eventer for any reason.


#### eventer_update

>Change the activity mask for file descriptor events.

```c
void 
eventer_update(evneter_t e, int mask)
```


  * `e` an event object
  * `mask` a new mask that is some bitwise or of `EVENTER_READ`, `EVENTER_WRITE`, and `EVENTER_EXCEPTION`

```c
void void 
eventer_update_whence(eventer_t e, struct timeval whence)
```


  * `e` an event object
  * `whence` an absolute time.


#### eventer_wakeup

>Signal up an event loop manually.

```c
void 
eventer_wakeup(eventer_t e)
```


  * `e` an event

The event `e` is used to determine which thread of the eventer loop to wake up.
If `e` is `NULL` the first thread in the default eventer loop is signalled. The
eventer loop can wake up on timed events, asynchronous job completions and 
file descriptor activity.  If, for an external reason, one needs to wake up
a looping thread, this call is used.

```


  * `e` an event object

If the function returns -1 and `errno` is `EAGAIN`, the `*mask` reflects the
necessary activity to make progress.

 *    * **RETURN** mtev_true if it was successful in parameterizing the CPU for rdtsc, mtev_false otherwise
 * 
 * Safe to call at any time but if you start_tsc, you should never need to call this
 * as the maintenance system can do it for you. However, if you find you need to call it
 * you must be bound to a thread using the mtev_thread APIs and the function will return
 * whether it was successful in parameterizing the CPU for rdtsc use.

void 
mtev_time_stop_tsc(void)
```

 *  
> Turn off TSC usage for the current cpu of this thread (from when start_tsc was called)


 

#### mtev_time_toggle_require_invariant_tsc

```c
void 
mtev_time_toggle_require_invariant_tsc(mtev_boolean enable)

```

 *  
> will switch on/off rdtsc usage across all cores regardless of detected state of rdtsc or start/stop usage.


 * 
 * Defaults to enabled.
 * 
 * This is independent of start_tsc/stop_tsc.  You can disable all and then reenable and the thread
 * will keep going using the state from the last start/stop_tsc

mtev_watchdog_start_child will fork and run the specified function in the child process.  The parent will watch.  The child process must initialize the eventer system and then call mtev_watchdog_child_hearbeat to let the parent know it is alive.  If the eventer system is being used to drive the child process, mtev_watchdog_child_eventer_heartbeat may be called once after the eventer is initalized.  This will induce a regular heartbeat.
