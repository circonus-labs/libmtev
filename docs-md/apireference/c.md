the concurrency of the default event pool.

This is done because many systems aren't thread safe and can only schedule their
work on a single thread (thread 1). By spreading all thread-safe workloads across
the remaining threads we reduce potential overloading of the "main" thread.

To assign an event to a thread, use the result of this function to assign:
`e->thr_owner`.

  * `n` an integer.
  * **RETURN** a pthread_t of an eventer loop thread in the specified evneter pool.

This function chooses a thread within the specified pool by taking `n`
modulo the concurrency of the pool.  If the default pool is speicified, special
assignment behavior applies. See [`eventer_choose_owner`](c.md#eventerchooseowner).

To assign an event to a thread, use the result of this function to assign:

```c
eventer_aco_t

```


  * `e` an event object
  * `co` a coroutine to which the event should bound. NULL to revert.
  * **RETURN** The converted event.

The input event is modified in-place.  If the NULL is passed as co,
then the event is reverted and NULL is returned.  You almost always
want to be calling this on a brand-new object or a `eventer_alloc_copy`
of a pre-existing object.

without changing any eventer state and should be used with extremem care.
Consider using the callback's return value or `eventer_update` to change
the mask of an active event in the system.

  * `e` an event object that is not registered with the eventer.
  * `mask` the mask to be used when invoking the event's callback.

This is often used to "start back up" an event that has been removed from the
eventer for any reason.


#### eventer_try_add_asynch

>Add an asynchronous event to a specific job queue.

```c
mtev_boolean
eventer_try_add_asynch(eventer_jobq_t *q, eventer_t e)
```


  * `q` a job queue
  * `e` an event object
  * **RETURN** `mtev_false` if over max backlog, caller must clean event.

This adds the `e` event to the job queue `q`.  `e` must have a mask
of `EVENTER_ASYNCH`.


#### eventer_try_add_asynch_dep

>Add an asynchronous event to a specific job queue dependent on the current job.

```c
mtev_boolean
eventer_try_add_asynch_dep(eventer_jobq_t *q, eventer_t e)
```


  * `q` a job queue
  * `e` an event object
  * **RETURN** `mtev_false` if over max backlog, caller must clean event.

This adds the `e` event to the job queue `q`.  `e` must have a mask
of `EVENTER_ASYNCH`.  This should be called from within a asynch callback
during a mask of `EVENTER_ASYNCH_WORK` and the new job will be a child
of the currently executing job.


#### eventer_try_add_asynch_dep_subqueue

>Add an asynchronous event to a specific job queue dependent on the current job.

```c
mtev_boolean
eventer_try_add_asynch_dep_subqueue(eventer_jobq_t *q, eventer_t e, uint64_t id)
```


  * `q` a job queue
  * `e` an event object
  * `id` is a fairly competing subqueue identifier
  * **RETURN** `mtev_false` if over max backlog, caller must clean event.

This adds the `e` event to the job queue `q`.  `e` must have a mask
of `EVENTER_ASYNCH`.  This should be called from within a asynch callback
during a mask of `EVENTER_ASYNCH_WORK` and the new job will be a child
of the currently executing job.


#### eventer_try_add_asynch_subqueue

>Add an asynchronous event to a specific job queue.

```c
mtev_boolean
eventer_try_add_asynch_subqueue(eventer_jobq_t *q, eventer_t e, uint64_t id)
```


  * `q` a job queue
  * `e` an event object
  * `id` is a fairly competing subqueue identifier
  * **RETURN** `mtev_false` if over max backlog, caller must clean event.

This adds the `e` event to the job queue `q`.  `e` must have a mask
of `EVENTER_ASYNCH`.


#### eventer_update

>Change the activity mask for file descriptor events.

```c
void
eventer_update(evneter_t e, int mask)
```


  * `e` an event object
  * `mask` a new mask that is some bitwise or of `EVENTER_READ`, `EVENTER_WRITE`, and `EVENTER_EXCEPTION`


#### eventer_update_whence

>Change the time at which a registered timer event should fire.

```c
void void
eventer_update_whence(eventer_t e, struct timeval whence)
```


  * `e` an event object
  * `whence` an absolute time.


#### eventer_wakeup

>Signal up an event loop manually.

```c
void
eventer_wakeup(eventer_t e)
```


  * `e` an event

The event `e` is used to determine which thread of the eventer loop to wake up.
If `e` is `NULL` the first thread in the default eventer loop is signalled. The
eventer loop can wake up on timed events, asynchronous job completions and
file descriptor activity.  If, for an external reason, one needs to wake up
a looping thread, this call is used.


#### eventer_watchdog_timeout

>Return the current watchdog timeout on this thread.

```c
double
eventer_watchdog_timeout(void)
```


  * **RETURN** A timeout in seconds, 0.0 if none configured.


#### eventer_watchdog_timeout_timeval

>Return the current watchdog timeout on this thread.

```c
mtev_boolean
eventer_watchdog_timeout_timeval(struct timeval *dur)
```


  * `dur` the timeval structure to populate with the timeout.
  * **RETURN** mtev_true if a timeout is set, mtev_false otherwise.


#### eventer_write

>Execute an opset-appropriate `write` call.

```c
int
eventer_write(eventer_t e, const void *buff, size_t len, int *mask)
```


  * `e` an event object
  * `buff` a buffer containing data to write.
  * `len` the size of `buff` in bytes.
  * `mask` a point the a mask. If the call does not complete, `*mask` it set.
  * **RETURN** the number of bytes written or -1 with errno set.

If the function returns -1 and `errno` is `EAGAIN`, the `*mask` reflects the
necessary activity to make progress.


#### mtev_ex_log

>Log to a log stream (metadata, va_list)

```c
int
mtev_ex_log(mtev_log_stream_t ls, const struct timeval *now, const char *file, int line,
            const mtev_log_kv_t *kvpairs, const char *format, ...)
```


  * `ls` a log stream
  * `now` the current time
  * `file` a source file name
  * `line` a source file line number
  * `kvpairs` a list of key-value metadata
  * `format` a `printf`-style format string
  * `arg` a `varargs` list
  * **RETURN** The number of bytes written or an approximation

This function (used by the `mtevL`, `mtevLT`, `mtevEL`, `mtevELT` macros) is responsible for logging.
A variery of metadata fields are created internally including timestamp, `threadname`, `threadid`,
facility (log name), file, and line.  These metadata fields are extended with those passed in
as `kvpairs`.  These KV pairs should be created with the `MLKV, MLKV_NUM, MLKV_STR, MLKV_END`
macros.  The message is formatted, filtering is applied and then the resulting payload is
pushed through the directed acyclic graph of log streams.  See `mtevEL` for examples.
 

#### mtev_ex_vlog

>Log to a log stream (metadata, `va_list`)

```c
int
mtev_ex_vlog(mtev_log_stream_t ls, const struct timeval *now, const char *file, int line,
             const mtev_log_kv_t *kvpairs, const char *format, va_list arg)
```


  * `ls` a log stream
  * `now` the current time
  * `file` a source file name
  * `line` a source file line number
  * `kvpairs` a list of key-value metadata
  * `format` a `printf`-style format string
  * `arg` a `varargs` list
  * **RETURN** The number of bytes written or an approximation

See mtev_ex_log.
 

### F

#### mtev_flow_regulator_ack

>Acknowledge processing mtev_flow_regulator_toggle_t instruction.

```c
mtev_flow_regulator_toggle_t
mtev_flow_regulator_ack(mtev_flow_regulator_t *fr, mtev_flow_regulator_toggle_t t)
```


  * `t` Instruction returned from previous call to `mtev_flow_regulator_raise_one`, `mtev_flow_regulator_lower`, or `mtev_flow_regulator_ack`.
  * **RETURN** New flow-toggle instruction.

The flow-regulator is designed to be usable in multi-producer
(where multiple concurrent entities may produce work) /
multi-consumer (where multiple concurrent entities may mark work
completed) scenarios, which means that many entities may be adding
and removing work from the flow-regulator at the same time. As
such, when one entity observes that the flow-regulator has become
disabled and takes some action to pause further work generation,
it's possible that enough work will have drained from the
flow-regulator that it needs to be re-enabled... Or, that after
re-enabling the flow-regulator, enough work was already being
scheduled that it needs to be disabled again. So
`mtev_flow_regulator_ack` returns a _new_ instruction, in case the
flow-regulator needs further adjustment. Clients are expected to
call this function in a loop, with the function's previous return
value, until the flow-regulator settles on
`MTEV_FLOW_REGULATOR_TOGGLE_KEEP` or
`MTEV_FLOW_REGULATOR_TOGGLE_DISABLED`. (There is no harm in
continuing to call `mtev_flow_regulator_ack` after it reaches one
of these values: it will eventually settle on
`MTEV_FLOW_REGULATOR_TOGGLE_KEEP`.)

The toggle-instruction should be interpreted as follows:

* `MTEV_FLOW_REGULATOR_TOGGLE_DISABLED`: Flow control is currently
  disabled. No client action necessary.
* `MTEV_FLOW_REGULATOR_TOGGLE_DISABLE`: Flow control _was_ enabled,
  and we've started transitioning to DISABLED. (The transition to
  DISABLED is not complete until the client calls
  `mtev_flow_regulator_ack`, again.) Client MAY try to prevent
  generating new work before calling `mtev_flow_regulator_ack`, again.
* `MTEV_FLOW_REGULATOR_TOGGLE_KEEP`: No client action required.
* `MTEV_FLOW_REGULATOR_TOGGLE_ENABLE`: Flow control _was_ disabled,
  and has just started transitioning to ENABLED. (The transition to
  ENABLED is not complete until the client calls
  `mtev_flow_regulator_ack`, again.) Client MAY re-enable
  work-generation before calling `mtev_flow_regulator_ack`, again.


To facilitate multi-producer / multi-consumer use, the
flow-regulator enforces that only _one_ client will see a
flow-toggling result (_i.e._ `MTEV_FLOW_REGULATOR_TOGGLE_ENABLE`
or `MTEV_FLOW_REGULATOR_TOGGLE_DISABLE`) until that client calls
`mtev_flow_regulator_ack`, and that the same toggling result will
not occur twice in a row across all concurrent clients.
 

#### mtev_flow_regulator_create

>Create a flow-regulator object.

```c
mtev_flow_regulator_t *
mtev_flow_regulator_create(unsigned int low, unsigned int high)
```


  * `low` Threshold that indicates when work flow should be re-enabled.
  * `high` Threshold at which to stop work flow. Must be strictly greater than `low`.
  * **RETURN** Flow-regulator object.

The returned flow-regulator object is "enabled" on creation. When
`high` work items are added (by `mtev_flow_regulator_raise_one`)
without being removed (by `mtev_flow_regulator_lower`), the
flow-regulator will become disabled. When `high - low` work-items
are subsequently marked done (by `mtev_flow_regulator_lower`),
without new work being added (by `mtev_flow_regulator_raise_one`),
the flow-regulator will transition back to "enabled".
 

#### mtev_flow_regulator_destroy

>Destroy a flow-regulator object.

```c
void
mtev_flow_regulator_destroy(mtev_flow_regulator_t *fr)
```


 

#### mtev_flow_regulator_lower

>Release space for work-items in a flow-regulator.

```c
mtev_flow_regulator_toggle_t
mtev_flow_regulator_lower(mtev_flow_regulator_t *fr, unsigned int by)
```


  * `by` Number of work-items to mark completed.
  * **RETURN** Action to take on releasing work.

See `mtev_flow_regulator_ack` for description of how to handle the
return value. This function will return one of:

  * `MTEV_FLOW_REGULATOR_TOGGLE_KEEP`
  * `MTEV_FLOW_REGULATOR_TOGGLE_ENABLE`
 

#### mtev_flow_regulator_raise_one

>Reserve space for a work-item in a flow-regulator.

```c
mtev_flow_regulator_toggle_t
mtev_flow_regulator_raise_one(mtev_flow_regulator_t *fr)
```


  * **RETURN** Success / fail status on inserting work.

See `mtev_flow_regulator_ack` for description of how to handle the
return value. This function will return one of:

* `MTEV_FLOW_REGULATOR_TOGGLE_DISABLED`
* `MTEV_FLOW_REGULATOR_TOGGLE_DISABLE`
* `MTEV_FLOW_REGULATOR_TOGGLE_KEEP`

Note that, unless the return value was
`MTEV_FLOW_REGULATOR_TOGGLE_KEEP`, space was _not_ reserved in the
flow-regulator for the work-item.
 

#### mtev_flow_regulator_stable_lower

```c
mtev_flow_regulator_toggle_t
mtev_flow_regulator_stable_lower(mtev_flow_regulator_t *fr, unsigned int by)
```

  * **RETURN** `mtev_true` if the caller is responsible for re-scheduling work-creation for the flow-regulator, `mtev_false` otherwise.

This function is a simple wrapper around
`mtev_flow_regulator_lower` and `mtev_flow_regulator_ack`, to
simplify handling in cases where the client needs take no explicit
action to enable or disable work-production before calling
`mtev_flow_regulator_ack`.
 

#### mtev_flow_regulator_stable_try_raise_one

```c
mtev_flow_regulator_toggle_t
mtev_flow_regulator_stable_try_raise_one(mtev_flow_regulator_t *fr)
```

  * **RETURN** mtev_true if work-item was successfully added to the flow regulator, mtev_false otherwise.

This function is a simple wrapper around
`mtev_flow_regulator_raise_one` and `mtev_flow_regulator_ack`, to
simplify handling in cases where the client needs take no explicit
action to enable or disable work-production before calling
`mtev_flow_regulator_ack`.
 

#### mtev_frrh_adjust_prob

>Change the replacement probability on a `mtev_frrh_t`.

```


  * `size` is the total capacity of the hash.
  * `datasize` is the fixed-size of the data which will be stored.
  * `prob` is the probability of replaement on collision (0 to UINT_MAX).
  * `hashf` is the hashing function, NULL uses XXH64.

  * **RETURN** a pointer to a `mtev_frrh_t` on success, NULL otherwise.
 

#### mtev_frrh_get

>Retrieves the data associated with the provided key from the cache.

```c
const void *
mtev_frrh_get(mtev_frrh_t *cache, const void *key, uint32_t keylen)
```

#### mtev_hash_adv

```c
int
mtev_hash_adv(mtev_hash_table *h, mtev_hash_iter *iter)
```


> iterate through key/values in the hash_table



  This is an iterator and requires the hash to not be written to during the
   iteration process.
   To use:
 mtev_hash_iter iter = MTEV_HASH_ITER_ZERO;

 while(mtev_hash_adv(h, &iter)) {
   .... use iter.key.{str,ptr}, iter.klen and iter.value.{str,ptr} ....

#### mtev_hash_adv_spmc

```c
int
mtev_hash_adv_spmc(mtev_hash_table *h, mtev_hash_iter *iter)
```


> iterate through the key/values in the hash_table



   This is an iterator and requires that if the hash it written to
   during the iteration process, you must employ SMR on the hash itself
   to prevent destruction of memory for hash resizes by using the
   special init function mtev_hash_init_mtev_memory.

   To use:
   mtev_hash_iter iter = MTEV_HASH_ITER_ZERO;

   while(mtev_hash_adv_spmc(h, &iter)) {

#### mtev_hash_init_mtev_memory

```c
void
mtev_hash_init_mtev_memory(mtev_hash_table *h, int size, mtev_hash_lock_mode_t lock_mode)
```


> choose the lock mode when initing the hash.



  It's worth noting that the lock only affects the write side of the hash,
  the read side remains completely lock free.

  This variant will use mtev_memory ck allocator functions to allow this
  hash to participate in SMR via mtev_memory transactions.  You need to wrap
  memory transactions in mtev_memory_begin()/mtev_memory_end()
 

#### mtev_hash_init_size

```c
void
mtev_hash_init_size(mtev_hash_table *h, int size)
```


> initialize a hash_table with an initial size

#### mtev_hash_merge_as_dict

```c
void
mtev_hash_merge_as_dict(mtev_hash_table *dst, mtev_hash_table *src)
```


> merge string values in "src" into "dst"



  This is a convenience function only.  It assumes that all keys and values
  in the destination hash are strings and allocated with malloc() and
  assumes that the source contains only keys and values that can be
  suitably duplicated by strdup().
 

#### mtev_hash_next

```c

  These are older, more painful APIs... use mtev_hash_adv
   Note that neither of these sets the key, value, or klen in iter


#### mtev_hash_next_str

```c
int
mtev_hash_next_str(mtev_hash_table *h, mtev_hash_iter *iter, const char **k, int *klen

  will return MTEV_HASH_SUCCESS on successful set with no replacement
  will return MTEV_HASH_FAILURE on failure to set
  will return MTEV_HASH_SUCCESS_REPLACEMENT on successful set with replacement
 

#### mtev_hash_size

```c

#### mtev_hash_store

```c
int
mtev_hash_store(mtev_hash_table *h, const void *k, int klen, const void *data)
```


> put something in the hash_table



  This will fail if the key already exists in the hash_table

  NOTE! "k" and "data" MUST NOT be transient buffers, as the hash table
  implementation does not duplicate them.  You provide a pair of
  NoitHashFreeFunc functions to free up their storage when you call
  mtev_hash_delete(), mtev_hash_delete_all() or mtev_hash_destroy().
 

#### mtev_html_encode

  * `src_len` The size (in bytes) of the raw data.
  * `dest` The destination buffer to which the function will produce.
  * `dest_len` The size of the destination buffer.
  * **RETURN** The size of the encoded output.  Returns zero is out_sz is too small.

```


> Create an LFU of max_entries size



  Will call free_fn when an item is evicted. if free_fn is null, call free().
  If max_entries == -1 then this devolves to a normal hashtable.

```c
mtev_lfu_entry_token
mtev_lfu_get(mtev_lfu_t *lfu, const char *key, size_t key_len, void **value)
```


> Get an item from the LFU by key



  This will fetch the item at "key" and put the value in "value". It will also
  return a token as the return value of the function.  This token is used
  as the checkout of the item from the LFU.  When you are finished using
  the value, you must call "mtev_lfu_release(mtev_lfu_t *lfu, mtev_lfu_entry_token token)"
  to let the LFU know that reclamation for that key/value is possible.

    * `lfu` The LFU to iterate
    * `callback` This function is called for each item in the LFU
    * `closure` The pointer to pass as the last param to the callback

  This leaves the LFU locked during iteration which will starve
  out other operations.  Keep this in mind if you are storing
  a lot of stuff in the LFU and have multithreaded access to it.

  The "key" and "value" passed to the callback function is direct
  LFU memory and should not be freed.


#### mtev_lfu_put

```c
mtev_lfu_put(mtev_lfu_t *lfu, const char *key, size_t key_len, void *value)
```


> Put a new item into the LFU

  restart the frequency count at 1.

  This will cause an eviction of the least frequently used item if the cache is full.
 

#### mtev_lfu_release

```c
void
mtev_lfu_release(mtev_lfu_t *lfu, mtev_lfu_entry_token token)

```


  * `name` The name of the "maybe" buffer.
  * `type` The type of the "maybe" buffer.
  * `cnt` The total number of elements expected in the allocation.

This macro will never reduce the size and is a noop if a size smaller
than or equal to the current allocation size is specified.  It is safe
to simply run this macro prior to each write to the buffer.
NOTE: this version is separate to avoid breaking existing code that uses the
older macro.  It allows usage with C++, which requires the memory allocation
pointer to be cast to the correct type before assignment.
 

#### MTEV_MAYBE_SIZE

>C Macro for number of bytes available in this buffer.

```c
MTEV_MAYBE_SIZE(name)
```

  * `ls` a log stream
  * `meta` extra metadata
  * `fmt` a `printf`-style format string
  * `...` `printf` arguments

This calls `mtevELT` with `NULL` as the time argument such that the current time is determined
in the logging system.  These short-form macros should almost always be used as they will
make efforts to skip evaluation of the arguments if the logging would not materialize anywhere.

Example: `mtevEL(mtev_error, MLKV{ MLKV_NUM("answer", 42"), MLKV_STR("question", "what?"), MLKV_END }, "hello %s\n", name);`

```


  * `s` the semaphore on which to wait
  * **RETURN** 0 on success or -1 on failure

This function is built on sem_wait, and sem_wait can fail in other ways besides
EINTR, such as due to EINVAL. These other failures will be due to mis-use of the
semaphore API -- e.g., by trying to `sem_wait` on a structure that was never
initialized with `sem_init`. Mis-using thread-synchronization primitives will
often lead to subtle, serious, and hard-to-reproduce bugs, so this function will
mtevFatal on other errors, rather than forcing clients to deal with (likely)
un-handlable errors. If your client code can handle these other errors, use
sem_wait directly, do not use this function.

mtev_boolean
mtev_time_maintain(void)
```


  * **RETURN** mtev_true if it was successful in parameterizing the CPU for rdtsc, mtev_false otherwise

Safe to call at any time but if you start_tsc, you should never need to call this
as the maintenance system can do it for you. However, if you find you need to call it
you must be bound to a thread using the mtev_thread APIs and the function will return
whether it was successful in parameterizing the CPU for rdtsc use.

```



   Defaults to enabled.
 

#### mtev_time_toggle_tsc

>will switch on/off rdtsc usage across all cores regardless of detected state of rdtsc or start/stop usage.

```c
void
mtev_time_toggle_tsc(mtev_boolean enable)
```



   Defaults to enabled.

   This is independent of start_tsc/stop_tsc.  You can disable all and then reenable and the thread
   will keep going using the state from the last start/stop_tsc

  * `sslconfig` optional, enables SSL using the contained config
  * **RETURN** boolean indicating success/failure

Clients allocated by this function are expected to be interacted with solely through the provided callbacks. There are two guarantees the caller must make:
1. The caller must not let a reference to the client escape from the provided callbacks.
2. The caller must not call `mtev_websocket_client_free()` with a reference to this client.


#### mtev_websocket_client_send
